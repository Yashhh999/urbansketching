                <p class="subtitle-text">Hey! I'm Yash, and I'm a sophomore at Lincoln High. Last year I got super bored during summer break and started sketching random buildings and people around my neighborhood. Turns out it's actually pretty fun, even when my drawings look terrible. Check out what I've been working on!</p>

            <h3>How I Got Started (AKA My Mom Made Me Go Outside)</h3>
            <div class="paragraph-dump">
                <p class="para-discovery">So basically last summer I was glued to my phone 24/7 playing games and watching TikTok. My mom got fed up and was like "Yash, you need to do something productive or I'm taking your phone." I was NOT about to let that happen. I remembered I had this old sketchbook from art class that I never used, so I grabbed it and went to sit on our front steps just to prove I was "being productive."</p>
                <p class="para-adventure">I started drawing our neighbor's house because it was right there, and honestly it looked pretty bad at first. But then I got kind of into it? Like, I never really looked at how the windows were shaped or how the roof tiles were arranged. After that I started walking around and finding other stuff to draw - there's this really cool brick wall behind the gas station that has all these interesting patterns.</p>
                <p class="para-community">The weirdest part is that people actually stop and talk to me when I'm drawing. Mrs. Rodriguez from down the street always brings me lemonade, and this one guy who works at the bike shop told me all these stories about how the neighborhood used to look different. I've learned more about where I live in the past year than I did in my whole life before. Plus my Instagram actually has interesting content now instead of just mirror selfies.</p>

            <p class="ambience-description">Sometimes I can't go outside to draw (like when it's raining or when I have tons of homework), so I found these background sounds that make it feel like I'm actually out in the city. They help me focus way better than music:</p>
