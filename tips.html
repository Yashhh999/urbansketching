                <p class="para-welcome">Okay so I've been sketching around the city for about a year now and I definitely did a lot of things wrong at first. These are the things I figured out that actually helped, plus some stuff I wish I'd known before I looked like a total weirdo sitting on sidewalks with a sketchbook.</p>


                <p class="para-journey">Drawing isn't about making everything perfect - it's more about noticing cool stuff around you that you'd normally just walk past. My first sketches were honestly pretty bad but each one helped me remember a moment or a place that I would've totally forgotten otherwise.</p>


                <p class="para-encouragement">Whether you've been drawing forever or you're just starting out, these tips should help you feel less awkward about drawing in public and actually enjoy the process instead of stressing about it.</p>

            <h3>Getting Started: Your First Sketch</h3>


            <div class="tip-cards-mess">


                <div class="single-tip-card">


                    <h4>üéØ Start With Easy Stuff</h4>


                    <p>Don't try to draw the entire downtown skyline on your first attempt! Start with simple things like a single building, a parked car, or a street sign. Get comfortable with the basics before you tackle complicated scenes with lots of details.</p>


                </div>


                <div class="single-tip-card">


                    <h4>‚è∞ Don't Rush It</h4>


                    <p>Give yourself at least 30-45 minutes for a decent sketch. I learned this the hard way when I tried to draw the public library in 15 minutes and it ended up looking like a kindergartener's drawing. Take your time and enjoy the process.</p>


                </div>


                <div class="single-tip-card">


                    <h4>üìç Find a Good Spot</h4>


                    <p>Look for places where you can sit comfortably without being in people's way. Park benches, cafe patios, and public squares are great starting points. Avoid busy sidewalks where you'll get bumped into constantly.</p>

                    <h4>The Basics</h4>


                    <ul class="supply-list-stuff">


                        <li><strong>Sketchbook:</strong> Get something around 5.5" x 8.5" with mixed media paper (big enough to draw but not huge to carry around)</li>


                        <li><strong>Pens:</strong> I use Sakura Pigma Micron pens in sizes 01, 03, and 05 - they don't smudge when they get wet</li>


                        <li><strong>Pencil:</strong> A regular 2B pencil for rough sketches (it erases cleanly if you mess up)</li>


                        <li><strong>Water Brush:</strong> Pentel Aquash brush for adding watercolor washes</li>


                        <li><strong>Something to Sit On:</strong> Trust me, your back will hate you if you don't bring a portable stool</li>

                    <ul class="supply-list-stuff">


                        <li><strong>Watercolors:</strong> A small set with basic colors</li>


                        <li><strong>Colored Pencils:</strong> For adding little details and color accents</li>


                        <li><strong>White Gel Pen:</strong> Good for highlights and fixing small mistakes</li>


                        <li><strong>Blending Stumps:</strong> Makes shading look smoother</li>


                        <li><strong>Small Ruler:</strong> Helps with drawing straight lines and perspective</li>


                    </ul>

                <h4>üí° If You're Broke Like Me</h4>


                <p>When I started I literally just had a cheap spiral notebook and some random pens from a convenience store. You don't need fancy supplies to make good art! I drew with basic stuff for months before I invested in "real" art supplies.</p>

            <h3>Basic Techniques: Building Your Skills</h3>

                <div class="technique-card">


                    <h4>üìê Perspective Made Simple</h4>


                    <p>Don't stress about perfect perspective! Start by observing where things line up. Hold your pencil at arm's length to check angles. Most importantly, trust your eyes - they're usually right.</p>


                </div>


                <div class="technique-card">


                    <h4>üåà Color Confidence</h4>


                    <p>Start with limited color palettes. I use warm browns, cool grays, and one accent color (usually blue or orange). This keeps sketches cohesive and prevents muddy colors.</p>


                </div>


                <div class="technique-card">


                    <h4>‚úèÔ∏è Line Weight Magic</h4>


                    <p>Vary your line thickness! Use thicker lines for foreground objects and shadows, thinner lines for details and background elements. This creates depth without complex shading.</p>


                </div>


                <div class="technique-card">


                    <h4>üíß Watercolor Basics</h4>


                    <p>Let ink dry completely before adding water! Start with light washes and build up slowly. It's easier to add more color than to remove too much.</p>

                    <h4>üôà The "People Are Watching Me" Fear</h4>


                    <p><strong>Reality check:</strong> Most people are too busy with their own lives to care about your sketching. And when they do notice? 9 out of 10 times, they're impressed and curious, not judgmental. I've had countless positive interactions with strangers who were excited to see someone drawing!</p>


                </div>


                <div class="tip-item">


                    <h4>üò§ The "My Art Isn't Good Enough" Voice</h4>


                    <p><strong>Perspective shift:</strong> Your sketches are personal documentation, not gallery pieces. They capture YOUR experience of a place and time. Even wonky proportions tell a story! Some of my favorite sketches are technically "flawed" but full of character.</p>


                </div>


                <div class="tip-item">


                    <h4>‚ö° The "I Don't Have Time" Excuse</h4>


                    <p><strong>Time hack:</strong> Even 15-minute sketches are valuable! I sketch during lunch breaks, while waiting for the bus, or when I arrive early to meet friends. Quick gesture sketches often capture energy better than labored drawings.</p>

The goal isn't to become the next Leonardo da Vinci - it's to develop a deeper connection with your surroundings and have fun doing it.</p>
